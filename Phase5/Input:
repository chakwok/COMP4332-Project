Design Report



Querying and Transformation 
The extraction of docuement from the mongo will be done using the pymongodb library. To get the course info(e.g. course title, course quota/ waiting list size at different timeslots), we would use the aggregate() function provided by Mongodb to return a CommandCursor object.

By iterating through the CommandCursor object(using a for loop), we can extract all the individual documents. As documents in mongodb behave like a json object, the input attribute that we want can be extracted simply by {jsonObject}['{attribute}'].

The output csv will be in a format of:
<code> <

*Missing value will be filled by averaging the nearest 3 values
