Design Report



Querying and Transformation 
The extraction of docuement from the mongo will be done using the pymongodb library. To get the course info(e.g. course title, course quota/ waiting list size at different timeslots), we would use the aggregate() function provided by Mongodb to return a CommandCursor object.

By iterating through the CommandCursor object(using a for loop), we can extract all the individual documents. As documents in mongodb behave like a json object, the input attribute that we want can be extracted simply by {jsonObject}['{attribute}'].

The output csv will be in a format of:
<code> <Semester> <title> <credits> <exclusion> <recordTime> <sectionId> <offerings> <quota> <enrol> <wait>

*Missing value will be filled by averaging the nearest 3 values 



Model 1: Baseline Prediction Model 1
This model will be used to set as the baseline of any prediction. 

Type: A system that takes the previous one entry and return it as the result of the prediction

Input Attribute: 
	waiting list size to "train"

Output Attribute:
	Accuracy



Model 2: Baseline Prediction Model 2 
Type: Moving Average (look_back = 3)
The model serves a similar purpose as baseline model, but it would go a step further to understand how to previous data points would affect the accuracy

Type: A system that takes the previous 3 data points and average them as the prediction results

Input Attribute: 
	waiting list size to "train"

Output Attribute:
	Accuracy
